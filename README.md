# Template: Python - Web Scraper

This template demonstrates a basic implementation of a web scraping robot using the [Robocorp framework](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp). It uses various libraries from the same project to create a working robot that performs web scraping tasks.

The template provides a minimal amount of functional code to help you get started. You will need to replace or extend the logic to suit your specific requirements.

# Code Challenge: Web Scraper with Robocorp

This code is part of a code challenge involving a web scraping robot using the [Robocorp framework](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp). The challenge focuses on creating a robot that performs tasks to produce and process work items. Below is an overview of the implemented functions and tasks.

## Tasks Overview

### `producer`

- Creates a work item from a CSV file.
- Uses the `get_csv_produce_work_item` function to read the CSV file and generate a payload for further processing.

### `scrapper`

This task processes work items generated by the `producer` task. It performs a series of web scraping operations based on the information contained in the work item.
